 PwC Cybersecurity Consulting – Virtual Internship (Forage) 🇺🇸

This repository documents the work completed as part of the **PwC US Cybersecurity Consulting Virtual Job Simulation**, delivered via [Forage](https://www.theforage.com). The internship focused on evaluating cybersecurity and audit controls in alignment with **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)** requirements, testing IT general controls (ITGCs), reviewing system design documentation, and summarising key compliance issues to a client-facing stakeholder.

📌 About the Programme

> “I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in the Enterprise Risk and Control Solutions group at PwC. I worked on a project to assess a client's process against Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requirements. I practiced using a Test of Design and Operating Effectiveness and built my analysis and presentation skills in a real-world context.”

📂 Tasks Completed

🧩 Task 1 – P2P Controls Gap Assessment

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the client's Procure-to-Pay (P2P) SOP for control deficiencies that could affect financial integrity, regulatory compliance, or operational risk.

**Approach:**  
- Reviewed the P2P SOP alongside cash disbursement control frameworks and ITGC principles.
- Identified high-risk gaps, including:
  - Absence of segregation of duties (e.g., the same person handling requisition, approval, and payment).
  - No formal supplier verification and onboarding process.
  - Weak access provisioning procedures and missing audit logs.

**Deliverable:**  
Submitted a detailed email to the senior associate highlighting both business process and system control deficiencies. Also included a set of targeted follow-up questions to address during the walkthrough. This task demonstrated risk-based analysis and professional communication in a consultancy-style format.

 🛠️ Task 2 – SDLC Audit Walkthrough

**Objective:**  
Conduct a walkthrough audit of the client's software development lifecycle (SDLC) process to identify deviations from the NIST SDLC framework.

**Approach:**  
- Compared the client's SDLC SOP against NIST standards to evaluate design coverage and control alignment.
- Identified issues such as:
  - Insufficient security integration in design and requirements phases.
  - Poor documentation of change validation and approval checkpoints.
  - Absence of risk assessments during project initiation.

**Walkthrough Highlights:**  
- Prepared and delivered a strategic set of audit questions to the IT manager (Bob), focusing on the identified control gaps.
- Demonstrated the ability to drive conversations during a time-limited stakeholder meeting and adjust based on brief or unclear answers.
- Reflected real-life skills used in IT risk interviews and SOX readiness engagements.

🔐 Task 3 – ITGC Testing of Design & Operating Effectiveness

**Objective:**  
Perform both a Test of Design (ToD) and a Test of Operating Effectiveness (ToOE) for two change management ITGCs used by MedTech’s CorpLaw system.

**Controls Tested:**

- **Control 1.2:** Emergency change approvals must be completed by the IT Director within 24 hours, with follow-up CAB approval within 5 days.
  - ✅ ToD: Confirmed approval protocol was well documented in the SOP.
  - ✅ ToOE: Change form evidence showed timely approval with proper timestamps and role-based signatures.

- **Control 1.3:** Developers and implementers must have fully separated access rights, with no overlapping roles.
  - ✅ ToD: Control structure enforced separation of duties at the role level.
  - ✅ ToOE: Verified actual user access data; no duplicate users existed across Dev and Imp roles.

**Skills Applied:**  
- Evidence-based testing using SOPs, real change request forms, and user access spreadsheets.
- Mapped testing steps to SOX compliance and documented detailed test results in PwC’s internal format.

🧾 Task 4 – Executive Summary Slide for Compliance Lead

**Objective:**  
Summarise the week's audit findings in a single board-ready slide for Tim White, MedTech's Compliance Programme Manager. This deliverable needed to be client-facing and concise, while covering critical risks and remediation steps.

**Summary Focus:**  
- Reported two key control exceptions in change management (CAB approval delays and a SoD violation).
- Highlighted the SDLC gap in early-phase security integration.
- Provided three targeted recommendations to remediate the control weaknesses:
  - Automate CAB follow-ups and escalation.
  - Enforce quarterly access reviews for developers and implementers.
  - Integrate security controls into each SDLC phase.

**Outcome:**  
Created a visually clean and technically sound summary slide suitable for a compliance discussion. The slide conveyed audit severity, business risk, and actionable solutions in a client-friendly format.
